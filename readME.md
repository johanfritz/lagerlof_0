## n_gram models
The repo contains functions and classes to generate a n_gram model for a given corpus. The *parse* class is used to, as the name suggests, parse the dataset. It takes only a filename at construction. The functions in the file *n_gram.py* are used to count the occurances of each n_gram in the corpus. In the *simple.py* file, there is a *generate()* method that can be used to generate text according to a model specified in the same file. It is preferabbly used in an interactive environment, at the momement. The *simple.py* file can be consulted for details on this.
